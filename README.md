Please give my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Alechilles/AlecsCats) a star if you enjoy the mod and/or found my mod helpful as a reference when building your own! <3

## Summary:

This mod makes use of the existing but unused Cat model and animations in the Hytale assets. Starting with the default Fox behavior, I've expanded it significantly with my own taming system and textures of my own cats.

## How Taming Works:

*   Taming Process: 
    *   Craft a Cat Collar at a Workbench (Tier 2) with 3 Light Leather and 1 Gold Bar
    *   Feed a cat a piece of raw fish to make it friendly
    *   Use the Cat Collar on the Cat to pick it up and tame it permanently
*   Tamed Behavior:
    *   Click with the Cat in your hand to place it in the world
    *   You will get the Collar back and can use it on the Cat again to pick it back up
    *   On placement it will stay still (default behavior so it doesn't chase you down if you left it somewhere and reloaded your game)
    *   Interact with the Cat with Raw Fish in your hand to feed the Cat and restore its health
    *   Interact with the Cat **without** Fish or a Collar in your hand to toggle modes
        *   Paw Print: Follow
        *   Hand: Stay
        *   Shield: Defend

## Spawns:

They are fairly uncommon, but not exceedingly rare. You are meant to have to look for one, but they're not meant to be super hard to find. If you search a biome thoroughly, you should usually find one ~60% of the time. They will usually spawn alone, but can spawn in groups of up to 3.

*   Zone 1 - Weight 4
    *   Plains
    *   Forests
*   Zone 3 - Weight 5
    *   Forests

## Color Variants Available:

*   Default black and white
*   Dark gray (Missy)
*   Light gray with a few white markings (Nyxie)

## Working On:

*   Refining the taming system
    *   More advanced defend combat behavior
*   Adding more variants
    *   Next is Lulu (White with gray/brown accents, like a toasted marshmallow) 
    *   If you want to see your own cat in the game, send me lots of pictures of your cat and if I can, I will try to make a texture for them in the game :)

## Future Plans:

*   Rare magical variants
*   Add more animations
*   Add kittens
*   Add dogs?
*   Add other kinds of pets?

## Known Issues:

*   Wake and Laydown animations are bad
    *   They are placeholders, taken from the Fox asset, so they don't work quite right, but they're better than nothing until I can figure out how to do some basic animation
*   Cat's textures are randomized upon storing and deploying
    *   This will be fixed soon, but it requires duplicating all my code, so I'm waiting till it's mostly done or I've found a way to componentize it
